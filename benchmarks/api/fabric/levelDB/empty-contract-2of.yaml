test:
  name: empty-contract-levelDB-2of
  description: This is a duration based benchmark targetting a Hyperledger Fabric network with a LevelDB world state database using the `fixed-asset` NodeJS chaincode contract that is interacted with via 
    a Fabric-SDK-Node Gateway. Each test round flexes the `emptyContract` method. Rounds run for evaluate and submit Gateway routes.

    number: 4
  rounds:
  - label: empty-contract-evaluate
    description: Test an evaluateTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `emptyContract`, which immediately returns a null response. This represents the fastest possible round trip time for an evaluateTransaction() method that does not touch the world state or perform any action.
